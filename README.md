# Financial Risk Management using Machine Learning on z/OS

This journey accesses a Financial Risk Management API published on IBM Bluemix with Machine Learning on z/OS running on the IBM Z Mainframe through a simulated retail bank system called MPLbank. 

# MPLbank

## Architecture

This journey accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates a Financial Risk Management System based on [Machine Learning for z/OS]. The initial predictive model was designed to deliver a score representing the probability of the capacity of loan refund for a banking customer according to their personal data. On top of these components, an API layer hosted in IBM Bluemix has been set up to deliver a Financial Risk Management API, illustrating an online decision for loans approval.

![alt text](images/mlz_architecture_mplbank.png "Architecture")

Following the below schema, the predictive model was built from data using IBM Machine learning tools. Banking customer data was selected (age, number of credit card, income and number of car loans) to predict a score (probability for capacity of loan refunding) and an action (next customer's behaviour). It was then trained using machine learning with 80% of historical data and evaluated with 20% of the historical data. This ensures the model is able to learn from fresh data.

![alt text](images/mlz_workflow.png "workflow")

Once the model was approved, it was deployed to act as a scoring service. On top of this service, an API was created and published to an API developer Portal and is now callable through API. 

The objectives of this journey are to discover, test and use this Financial Risk Management API using a sample financial application, then enhance it using IBM Bluemix.
